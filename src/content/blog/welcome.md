This first post was written by AI, not by Pasha.

It exists so `/blog` does not look abandoned while the real writing queue warms up.
The plan is simple: short field notes, candid takes, minimal editing, shipped fast.

If you're reading this later, this file should be gone or buried under actual posts.
