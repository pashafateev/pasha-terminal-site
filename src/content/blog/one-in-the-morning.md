It’s one in the morning, and just for context, I do not usually, or at least try not to, stay up after about 10:30. This is the second night
  in a row that I’m staying up. I cannot stop playing with the new AI tools.

  I realized that there are a lot of people right now talking about how insane this is and that I am not special in any shape or form with what
  I’m saying. I am going to document this moment because one day I might look back and think, “Wow, that’s what it was like before
  whatever crazy thing that’s about to happen happens.”

  It’s hard to describe what I’m experiencing. It’s partially fear. Fear that I’m going to lose my job as a software engineer. In
  a way, I already have, even though I’m employed and have the best job I’ve ever had.

  But the job is no longer the same. The job that I studied for is not the job that I’m doing. The job that I did internships for is not the job
  that I’m doing today. It's similar, but it is no longer the same. It
  is changing every single day, and it also creates a tremendous amount of excitement and an almost uncontrollable desire to build something.

  I have had
  so many ideas, and I do not come from a coding history and background. Yes, I went to computer science school, but I am 34 years old. I went
  back to school when I was 27 to get my bachelor’s, and I’ve been working professionally in the field for about two years, a large chunk of
  which included about six months looking for a job because I got laid off.

  I just heard about OpenClaw, not just heard about it, but heard about it enough to be convinced to try it, and I haven’t even set it up
  yet. I'm taking it slow because I want to do it in a safe and contained environment, but my mind is already exploding with ideas on how to use
  it.

  I believe this world is not going to look the same ever again. On the one hand, I know I cannot predict what’s going to happen. On the other
  hand, it feels like something inevitable, like a force of gravity. Something big is about to happen, and what a time to be alive!
