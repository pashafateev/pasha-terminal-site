    aboutMe={`Hi, I'm Pasha. I used to mix sound — now I mix Python and Go. After studying CS at UW and surviving two internships, I joined AutoKitteh, where I build automations, wrangle APIs, and occasionally write code that works on the first try. I'm all about clean code, weird bugs, and laughing at my own commits.`}
