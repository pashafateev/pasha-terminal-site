	aboutMe={`From mixing beats to mixing bytes — plot twist! After crushing CS at UW and surviving the intern hunger games, I landed at AutoKitteh where I became the API whisperer. A worthy mention? A digital bouncer that booted inactive GitHub Copilot users (politely — with a "hey, you still with us?" Slack message). Check out the project: github.com/autokitteh/kittehub/tree/main/github_copilot_seats. I write code cleaner than my apartment, debug like a detective on coffee, and occasionally write code that works on the first try. Currently accepting payment in pizza and good vibes.`}
