    aboutMe={`Hi, I'm Pasha — a backend engineer who enjoys writing production-quality code and solving real-world problems. At AutoKitteh, I built event-driven workflows in Python and integrations in Go for third-party platforms, including a bidirectional sync between Linear and an enterprise app using OAuth and gRPC. I've worked with APIs from GitHub, AWS, Slack, Google, Discord, and OpenAI, and contributed upstream to PyGithub. I'm especially interested in backend engineering, developer experience, and learning more about distributed systems.`}
