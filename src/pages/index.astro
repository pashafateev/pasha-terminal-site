    aboutMe={`Hi, I'm Pasha — a backend engineer who enjoys writing production-quality code and solving real-world problems. After earning my CS degree at UW and completing two internships, I joined AutoKitteh, where I built event-driven workflows in Python and integrations in Go for third-party platforms. One highlight: a bidirectional sync between Linear and an enterprise app, handling OAuth, gRPC streams, and error recovery while preventing sync loops. I've worked with APIs from GitHub, AWS, Slack, Google, Discord, OpenAI, and beyond, and also contributed upstream to PyGithub to support missing functionality. I'm especially interested in backend engineering, improving developer experience, and learning more about distributed systems. I'm eager to take on challenging problems and continue growing as an engineer in my next role.`}
