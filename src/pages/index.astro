    aboutMe={`Hi, I'm Pasha — a backend engineer who started out wiring up audio and now wires up backend systems with the same attention to detail and curiosity. At AutoKitteh, I led a 0-to-1 project delivering bidirectional sync between third-party platforms, designed scalable event-driven pipelines with gRPC and OAuth, and built 10+ integrations across services like GitHub, Slack, Google, and Linear. Along the way, I contributed upstream to PyGithub, improved developer experience through samples and tooling, and tackled tough bugs in production. I'm curious about distributed systems and passionate about growing as an engineer by working on complex, meaningful challenges.`}
